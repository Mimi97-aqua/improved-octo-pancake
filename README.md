# TRIVIA NINJA LLM PROJECT

## About the Project

Trivia Ninja is an application which adopts a gamified approach to learning. Therefore, it requires as many questions as possible. Doing this manually would be time consuming so I worked on this API which the app can call to generate new questions as required.

This feeds off of OpenAI's API for Chat Completions. This code is made available so it can be customized and used for similar applications/use cases.
